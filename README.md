Port of the Android Stalker Cat live wallpaper to Wallpaper Engine.

This is a scene-based wallpaper written in SceneScript.

## Features

This version supports all the features of the original, including iteration and customization of individual elements:

- Dynamic resolution: The cat's size and background adapt seamlessly to your screen's aspect ratio, whether in landscape or portrait mode, without cropping.
- Mobile support: Compatible with Android devices.
- Interactive: Click or tap to hide the cat (this feature can be disabled in the settings).
- Extensive Customization: Personalize all elements, including the background, the cat's body, and its eyes.
- Adjustable Linger Time: Choose how long the cat stays on-screen—Skittish, Mildly Interested, or Very Interested.
- Customizable Cat Size: Scale the cat up for visibility on smaller screens (e.g., mobile phones) or reduce its size for larger screens.

## Credits

- Creators of the original version: Anne Pätzke, Winterlight.
- Upscale and logic (SceneScript): by me.
